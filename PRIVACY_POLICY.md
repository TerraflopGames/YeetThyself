**Privacy Policy**

Effective Date: 03/15/2025

Yeet Thyself ("the App") is developed by Terraflop Games ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data in relation to the App.

### 1. Information We Collect
The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The only data saved by the App is the user's game score, which is stored locally on the device using Unity's `Application.persistentDataPath`. This data is not shared, uploaded, or transmitted in any way.

### 2. How We Use Information
Since the App does not collect personal data, there is no usage of such data beyond storing the game score locally for gameplay purposes.

### 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not share, sell, or disclose any user data, as the App does not collect or process personal information.

### 4. Data Security
Since all game score data is stored locally on the user's device, we do not manage or control any remote storage. Users are responsible for managing their own saved data on their devices.

### 5. Children's Privacy
The App does not collect personal data and is designed for general audiences. If you are a parent or guardian and have any concerns, you may delete the App to remove any locally stored game data.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated version on this page.

**Privacy Policy**

Effective Date: 03/29/2025

Yeet Thyself ("the App") is developed by Terraflop Games ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data in relation to the App.

### 1. Information We Collect
The App collects and processes the following data:
- **Game Scores**: The App stores the user's game score locally on the device using Unity's `Application.persistentDataPath`.
- **Google Play Leaderboards**: If the user chooses to participate in Google Play Leaderboards, the App will submit their game score to Google Play Services. This process is handled by Google, and we do not store or manage this data.

### 2. How We Use Information
We use the collected data solely for gameplay purposes, including:
- Storing game scores locally for player reference.
- Submitting scores to Google Play Leaderboards if the user opts in.

### 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not share, sell, or disclose any personal user data. However, if the user participates in Google Play Leaderboards, their scores and related game data are managed by Google Play Services under Google's Privacy Policy.

### 4. Data Security
All locally stored game data remains on the userâ€™s device. Scores submitted to Google Play Leaderboards are handled securely by Google. Users can manage their leaderboard data through their Google Play account settings.

### 5. Children's Privacy
The App does not collect personal data beyond what is necessary for gameplay features. If you are a parent or guardian and have concerns, you can manage Google Play settings to restrict access to leaderboards.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated version on this page.
